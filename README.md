# AI Capstone Project – E-commerce - SimpliLearn Project

Project is divided into many tasks which went challenging many times which solving issues like specially the GPU and Neurons part which gave me understanding of concepts which are related to the same projects I explored many other data sources which are necessary to complete the given tasks.
	**Some sources are:**
    -	Scikit-learn official Documentation
    -	Stackoverlow
    -	GutHub
    -	Kaggle
**Week – 1:** was mostly about the data science and data engineering parts like EDA on the data
	We have 3 data files called – 1. Train_data.csv, test_data_hidden.csv and test_data.csv which are used to train and test the data and complete the tasks
**Week – 2:** was mostly about the Class imbalance issue which is resolved using logistics regression and TFIDF on oversampled and under sampled data can be seen in the source code attached
**Week – 3:** was mostly about applying machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistics Regression and Naïve Bayes on train and test data and finding best suitable ML algo on the same sentiment analysis to be done for the Amazon reviews
**Week – 4:** Was al about the Deep Learning algorithms implementations and finding out which algo works better on the same 

**Result: -** We can see from above that LSTM and GPU models are not efficient in predicting minor classes. ANN is performing quite good in solving class imbalance problem but it cannot beat traditional ML algorithms.
